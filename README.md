# Logic Tensor Network and Entity Embeddings

+ You can find everything in the notebook. Inside it you will be able to load all the datasets and test both the DNN and the Logic Tensor Network.

+ For PSL you can use the code available on the [original repo](https://github.com/linqs/psl-examples)

+ We used the original implementation of [LTNs](https://github.com/logictensornetworks/logictensornetworks)
