How To Run
==========

* All the dataset are available in the `dataset` folder

* You can find everything in the jupyter notebook. Inside it you will be able to load all the datasets and test both the DNN and the Logic Tensor Network.

* For PSL you can use the code available on the `original repo <https://github.com/linqs/psl-examples>`_

* We used the original implementation of `LTNs <https://github.com/logictensornetworks/logictensornetworks>`_
